What does this mean?
"AI Anywhere" is not an open source. I use some open source tools to build it, but the addon itself is closed source.

Why?
Programming is my hobby, but I'm not a hobby programmer :).
I work on my addons full time, every day, often also on weekends. And I've been doing so for a several years now.
My only income are donations, and as you can see on my Patreon page, I'm not doing so well:
https://www.patreon.com/fastaddons

If I want to keep doing this, I need to monetize my work. And since I hate ads, and I'm not willing to sacrifice user privacy by sharing data with a 3rd party, the only option is a "Freemium" model - where basic features are free and premium features are paid.
Sadly, "freemium" doesn't go well with "opensource" since anyone could copy it and release it fully free.
I guess any addon developer would tell you that making a living out of addons development is hard...

Is it safe to use non-open source software?
Sadly, there is no difference - in fact, in the past, several open source projects were sold to a 3rd party (for a high price) and become malware in the next release (for example "Nano Defender").
There is no validation that the author submitted his GitHub version to the store! It's a false sense of security!
It's always important that you trust the author of the addon, not the addon itself.

I'm not going to sell my addons to anyone and I don't plan to retire any time soon as I'm only 34 years young :).
And did you know I'm official "Friend of Addons" at Mozilla? :)
